## Preparation

1. Get the **Internet IP** on your Cloud Platform
2. Check you **[Inbound of Security Group Rule](https://support.websoft9.com/docs/faq/tech-instance.html)** of Cloud Console to ensure the TCP:80 is allowed
3. Make a domain resolution on your DNS Console if you want to use domain for Scratch

2. Scratch loads data for more than 20M for the first time. If your network bandwidth is insufficient, the loading will be slow and wait patiently.

## Q&A

#### I can't visit the start page of Scratch?

Your TCP:80 of Security Group Rules is not allowed so there no response from Chrome or Firefox

#### Is Scratch open very slowly?

Scratch first loaded data over 20M. For example, if you are using 2M bandwidth, then the ideal load time is: 2000k / (128k/s Ã— 2) = 7.8s. Obviously, if the bandwidth is insufficient, the speed will be very slow.
